<!-- <h3 id="data-collection">Data collection</h3> -->
<p>We use <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/devtools_network/">Chrome Extension</a> to collect HTTP and JavaScript request chains. You may conduct a new crawl or use the homepage crawl of sample 10 websites in <a href="https://github.com/uiowa-irl/Khaleesi/blob/main/data/non-interactive-crawl.7z">data</a>. The remaining data sets used in the paper are available on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7374344">Zenodo</a>.</p>
<p>For each webpage, our crawler outputs a JSON file that maps
  each network request to its initiator script and method .
  We then label each network request and its initiator code (e.g., JS
  script and methods) as tracking or functional using filter lists.</p>

<h2 id="feature-extraction-and-transformation"> Localizing Tracking and Functional JS Code</h2>
<p>We adapt SBFL to localize tracking code units (i.e., scripts, methods). We analyze each network request and the methods and scripts in the call stack trace of the network request. We use filter lists to classify a request (and
  its call stack) as tracking and functional. We then calculate “tracking score” for
  each code unit (i.e., script or method) based on its participation in
  the call stack trace of tracking and functional requests</p>

<h3 id="training-the-model">JS Blocking Impact Analysis</h3>
<p>We conduct blocking analysis in six
  parallel configurations shown in the Table below. These configurations are
 inspired by unique
 JS blocking strategies that are mostly in practice or proposed by
  prior work. Control configuration (CTRL) is used to localize JS code
  units (scripts and methods) using the aforementioned SBFL tech-
  nique and for breakage comparison in the later subsection. In ALL,
  all scripts (tracking, mixed, and functional) are blocked to evaluate
  blanket JS blocking. This configuration represents NoScript, which
  blocks all scripts by default. In TS, tracking scripts are blocked to evaluate selective JS blocking. This configuration represents ma-
  jority of content blockers such as uBlock Origin , Brave,
  and Adblock Plus that use EasyListand EasyPrivacy . In
  MS, mixed scripts are blocked to see its adverse consequence on
  functionality. In TMS, tracking and mixed scripts are blocked to eval-
  uate tracking and mixed JS blocking. TMS is the optimum choice for
  content blockers in tracking prevention, but it risks functionality
  breakage. Finally, we compare the results
  of TMS with TM, where we block tracking methods (all located in
  tracking and mixed scripts) to evaluate method-level JS blocking.</p>

<p><strong>Blocking JavaScript without Breaking the Web</strong><br>
Abdul Haddi Amjad, Zubair Shafiq, Muhammad Ali Gulzar<br>
<em>Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS), 2023</em></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Modern websites heavily rely on JavaScript (JS) to implement le-
  gitimate functionality as well as privacy-invasive advertising and
  tracking. Browser extensions such as NoScript block any script
  not loaded by a trusted list of endpoints, thus hoping to block
  privacy-invasive scripts while avoiding breaking legitimate website
  functionality. In this paper, we investigate whether blocking JS on
  the web is feasible without breaking legitimate functionality. To this
  end, we conduct a large-scale measurement study of JS blocking on
  100K websites. We evaluate the effectiveness of different JS block-
  ing strategies in tracking prevention and functionality breakage.
  Our evaluation relies on quantitative analysis of network requests,
  and resource loads as well as manual qualitative analysis of visual
  breakage. First, we show that while blocking all scripts is quite effec-
  tive at reducing tracking, it significantly degrades functionality on
  approximately two-thirds of the tested websites. Second, we show
  that selective blocking of a subset of scripts based on a curated list
  achieves a better tradeoff. However, there remain approximately
  15% “mixed” scripts, which essentially merge tracking and legit-
  imate functionality and thus cannot be blocked without causing
  website breakage. Finally, we show that fine-grained blocking of
  a subset of JS methods, instead of scripts, reduces major breakage
  by 3.7× while providing the same level of tracking prevention. Our
  work highlights the promise and open challenges in fine-grained
  JS blocking for tracking prevention without breaking the web.</p>
